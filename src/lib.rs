//! # Data Structures
//!
//! This is a repository I made to have some fun coding data structures I learned at my university. Feel free to go around and play with it too.
//! Remember that this isn't meant to be used in production as you'll probably find better, optimized structures elsewhere.
//!
//! The only thing here is [BinarySearchTree], which is a mostly recursive implementation of BSTs using chaining.
